# Step Cards

This app will 
- scan Markdown file (file having `.md` extension) inside articles directory,
- turn it to HTML
- chop HTML content by `<hr />` tag to turn it into Bootstrap 4 cards

# Why

I have documenting my learning using a simple text solution (A `vimwiki` synchronized using Dropbox). This has served me well for retaining knowledge. What it lacks mainly is the ability to compare between code block. This is why I use cards and lined horizontally.
